This repository contains tests that we ask candidates applying for a Customer Support Engineer position at Sauce Labs to complete. 

Try to complete as many of the tasks as you can. If youâ€™re applying for a Senior CSE position, we expect you to at least attempt all tasks.

When submitting your completed tests to our team, please include the following:

1. Either a zip file containing your final test code, or a link to your github repo if you cloned this.
2. The Sauce Labs username you ran your tests as.
